Want to create .ics files
I downloaded an .ics file and looked at it - it's a text file, phew
It has these main parts
Did some googling to find what's essential
I'm going to create an example file for myself first, before I automate it
VCALENDAR common to all
VTIMEZONE not strictly necessary as I'm lucky I'm only going up to September. But worth learning about for future, and in case I want to use this later
I could easily have just programmatically taken off an hour since they're all in BST, and converted to UTC instead. If I don't do this, there could be issues on the off chance someone takes one of these events and tries to edit it for their own purposes
If you need to know more about recurring events, you'll find all kinds of resources with a Google search
I'm going to have to create a UID. This is so that the program that reads the events can keep track of the event, if it's shared and then needs to be cancelled or modified
DTSTAMP is the creation of a particular VEVENT-message. If an event is created, modified, or cancelled, each of those are a different VEVENT message. You can also include a different property CREATED, which is when the event-object (with a specific UID) was created
Writing description: seeing which keywords I'll need to pick out automatically from the html
UID: theoretically, I could create more than one event per second. I'm going to add in an integer representing each object's position in the list. I'm also going to store which integer I got up to at the end, so I can continue creating events in the same format when I add more to the website later. I'm not going to store which integer goes with which event, as if any of these need editing later, I plan to just go in and do it manually rather than using Python. 
VALARM: I found docs online saying -P10M, which is incorrect: that appears to be 10 months before time! 
Put through .ics validator
Check in Google Calendar

Add to webpage. Look for a font-awesome icon
I don't like calendar-plus: it looks like Holby City's coming on an old-fashioned TV. I'm going to use calendar-alt
All my CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript is already here, along with most of the html for the webpage. I just need to add in the icons and links. 

Google Calendar url: less required. No notification, no busy status. It opens straight to an editable event creation template. Don't need to escape most characters, except %0A for new line. 

Ok it's time to automate it. 
Put it Python file headers. Going to put the output in the test directory so I don't commit any terrible blunders like overwriting the whole thing. And import os
Rather than use urllib, I'm just going to bring in and write out the html file as text, and store it in a list of lines. Since all I'm going to be doing is adding small things to the html
Many of my html lines begin with tabs or multiple spaces. I'm going to read them with lstrip to ensure I'm only reading the content that matters. 
I'm going to put in an example chunk of html, the ViPerCon conference, again to test what I'm doing
look for linestart
Next look for columnb1. We now need to deal with a date and a time, so I'm going to import the datetime modeule. I'm also going to import tz from date util, and define the London timezone. If I had to deal with other timezones, I'd define them too. This isn't needed here, but if I need to use it with other timezones it's ready.
